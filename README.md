Export Sheet Data is an add-on for Google Sheets that allows sheets to be exported as JSON or XML.

Goals
-----
**Convenient:** Export Sheet Data is meant to be simple to use but very powerful. No more exporting multiple CSVs then compiling data.

**Customizable:** Options and formats can be tweaked to reflect personal taste. Newline or sameline braces for JSON. Attributes or child elements for XML. Format your data the way you want.
